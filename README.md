# Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services

This project uses HTML and CSS to display a webpage outlining Horiseon Social Solution Services. I started with a mostly complete website and refactored the code to fix broken links, meet acessibility standards, and better organize the existing code.

More specifically, I changed the <div> elements to semantic html elements for clarity, including <nav> for the navigation links and <aside> for the portion on the right-hand side. I also added descriptors to the style.css file to better indicate the sections of the page that each rule set corresponded with. I consolodated the classes that used the same properties and values within them into one rule set each, and then changed the class selectors, and the classes in the html file, in order to utilize only one class per rule set in the css file. I also added descriptive alt text for each image, and changed the title of the page to simply the name of the company. These changes make the code for this page more clear and concise.
